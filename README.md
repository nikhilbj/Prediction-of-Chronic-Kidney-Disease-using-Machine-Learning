# Prediction-of-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-using-Machine-Learning


A. Missing Value Handling: In the pre-processing step, missing values have to be
handled based on their distributions to achieve reasonable accuracy
B. Data Preprocessing : Feature Selection
C. Model Training:In this work, 11 classification models can be taking in to
consideration . They are logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
regression, SVC with a linear kernel, SVC with RBF kernel, Gaussian NB,
decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, XGB classifier, extra trees
classifier, an ada boost classifier and a classical neural network.
D. Find out which fits the best and gives the best Accuracy to the model.
